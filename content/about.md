Hello, I'm Sandra, a novice Python data analyst and coder. I have a deep passion for the advancements in Artificial Intelligence and its profound impact on our society's future.

This website serves as a documentation of my journey into the realms of Data Analytics and Machine Learning, where I will also showcase my personal projects.

My aim is to continuously enhance my analytics skills by diving into hands-on experiences and applying cutting-edge techniques. 

There is no PhDâ€™s on my wall, but I firmly believe that the best way to learn is by doing, and I'm excited to tackle challenges, explore new methodologies, and make effective use of data to drive impactful decisions.

Beyond my personal growth, I am equally driven to inspire fellow beginners in analytics. 
I understand the challenges faced by newcomers and the importance of effectively communicating their own projects. 

By sharing my experiences, providing guidance, and fostering a supportive community, I aim to empower others to confidently showcase their work and make a meaningful impact in the analytics world.

# Technical Skills

Coming from a background in Graphic Design, I have a keen eye for data visualization. Transforming complex datasets into easily understandable visual representations has become my hobby. I consider Python plotting libraries to be my closest allies in achieving this.

My technical journey began with a strong focus on software development, UI design, and backend engineering, which I pursued through intensive bootcamps.
These experiences provided a solid foundation for my subsequent exploration of data analytics and machine learning, which I also delved into through a dedicated bootcamp.

Along the way, I gained a deep understanding of Python and SQL, and proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java. 

I am thrilled to leverage these skills to extract insights from data, create compelling narratives that resonate with diverse audiences and craft impactful presentations of those insights.

Feel free to explore my portfolio and join me on this exciting journey of discovery and growth in the realm of Data Analytics and Machine Learning.
